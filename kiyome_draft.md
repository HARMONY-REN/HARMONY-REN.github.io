# The Kiyome Program
This document outlines a roadmap for creating a purified ecosystem, one that moves beyond the limitations of current technology.
To drive true innovation, existing technologies and conventional approaches must be reconsidered.
All projects will operate in full compliance with applicable jurisdiction-specific laws.
The projects listed below are presented in order of dependency.

## The xarch computer architecture
A modular, transparent, and fully documented computer architecture designed for simplicity and high performance.

The architecture will evolve through three main branches:
- xwm: short for "waiting for xarch", an architecture image loader that provides early compatibility with modern systems while preparing for the full materialization of xarch.
- FPGA: a synthesizable version of the architecture for modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays.
- Production: the final, real-world implementation, bringing the architecture into physical manufacturing.

For now, emphasis will be placed on **xwm** to allow rapid prototyping and iteration, letting the emerging ecosystem mature naturally.

## The shoyuuken programming language

Shoyuuken, from 所有権, meaning 'ownership', is a middle level programming language that translates into the bare micro-op CPU language of xarch
