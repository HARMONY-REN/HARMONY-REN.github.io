# The Kiyome Program  

The Kiyome Program marks the birth of the  Open Innovation Collective HARMONY連, a dynamic network of domain-specific departments designed to unite, 
innovate, and create without boundaries.

Rooted in the frustrations of fragmented efforts, HARMONY連 was conceived with a single driving vision: to empower collaboration and cultivate innovation.
Our guiding principles are innovation, freedom, transparency, security, openness, sustainability, trust, and accountability.

All departments are designed to collaborate seamlessly, ensuring knowledge and resources flow efficiently across initiatives.

## Projects
Listed below are the briefly plotted projects that the R&D department will manage.  

### The xarch computer architecture  

A transparent and modular computer architecture, with attention at the transistor level, divided into three main branches:  

- **xwm**: acronym for *“waiting for xarch”*, an architecture image loader for xarch images.  
  Enables early ecosystem formation on modern systems, while also bridging to existing platforms.  

- **FPGA**: the synthesizable version of the xarch architecture on Field Programmable Gate Arrays,  
  for testing or practical applications.  

- **Production**: the actual manufacturing and realization of the computer architecture.  

Particular focus will be drawn on **xwm**, allowing prototyping, iteration, and maturation—precisely, *“waiting for xarch.”*

### The Shoyuuken (所有権) programming language  
From Japanese, meaning *“ownership”*, **Shoyuuken** is a mid-level language that acts as a bridge between hardware and user,  
allowing both direct component access and high-level abstractions.  

On the bridged versions of xwm’s xarch images, a **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)** is expected,  
for ease of development and compatibility.  

---

### The Shoyuuken (所有権) Kernel  

A bare-bones kernel that provides simplified access to peripherals through system calls.  

---

### Void Engine  

A physics engine built with Shoyuuken, for both experimental and production simulations,  
with support for plugin injections. Initial plugins will include:  

- **Void Vision**: for 2D and 3D rendering, as well as user-input detection.  
- **Void Forge**: for manufacturing objects at user-defined scales.  
---

### The Shoyuuken (所有権) Operating System  

A bundle of software living on top of the Shoyuuken Kernel,  
providing comfort, usability, and full ownership of the entire system.  

---

### Tsugou (都合)

From Japanese, meaning *“convenience”*, **Tsugou** is a multi-purpose tool implementing the following functionalities:  

- **Authenticity**: Digital Signature Algorithms (DSA) at the core of the Open Innovation Collective,  
  ensuring proof of ownership.  

- **Version Control System**: project versioning for collaboration and trusted cooperation between parties.  

- **Project Templating**: user-defined templates for rapid project iterations,  
  with workspace synchronization across multiple systems.  

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: all core functionalities will rely on quantum-resistant algorithms,  
  such as **ML-DSA-87** for authenticity and **ML-KEM-1024** for encapsulation.

### ShoChat (所Chat)

From Japanese, meaning **a place**, is a quantum proof chatting platform that makes usage of Post Quantum Cryptography to ensure safety and secrecy,
while also simplifying identity management and cloud access.
